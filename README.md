# Tasks
## Tags for the tasks
Tasks are tagged with Task-1 ...

## how to run "backend"
I added a shortcut for this. It can be started with `npm run server` - It will start on Port 3001.

## how to run app
- As all Tasks are created with react (typescript) and as css framework bootstrap, it is required to install all 
  dependencies with `npm i`
- you can start the project via `npm start` (will be started at default port http://localhost:3000)
- or create a build (`npm build`) and run it on any webserver that is configured accordingly.

## Some words to the tasks:
### Task 1/general:
I decided after reading all tasks to go with react directly as all tasks will be built on top of each other.
As I was allowed to take my favorite frameworks, I decided to go with react, typescript, scss and bootstrap.

To start the project as fast as possible, I started with create-react-app and template typescript.

As the task is to show a index.html with a js and an css - I was not sure if this approach could be a bit 
misleading - but at least after running react is already doing this. At this step the App only shows an 
Headline (h1) with Hello World as required.
